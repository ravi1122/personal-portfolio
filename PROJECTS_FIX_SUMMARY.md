# Projects Page Loading Issue - Fixed

## Issue Identified
The Projects page/section was not loading properly in the portfolio application.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the `useIntersectionObserver` hook import and usage in the Projects component, which was causing compilation errors and preventing the component from rendering.

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Removed Problematic Imports
- Removed `useIntersectionObserver` and `useImagePreloader` imports from the Projects component
- These performance optimization hooks were causing dependency issues

### 2. Simplified Component Structure  
- Removed image preloading logic that was using the problematic hook
- Simplified the ProjectCard component by removing the intersection observer reference
- Maintained all core functionality while removing complex performance optimizations

### 3. Fixed Compilation Errors
- Eliminated the "useIntersectionObserver is not defined" error
- Ensured the component compiles successfully without warnings

## Key Changes Made

### Before (Problematic):
```javascript
import { useIntersectionObserver, useImagePreloader } from '../hooks/usePerformance';

// Image preloading with problematic hook
const { loadedImages } = useImagePreloader(projectImages);

// ProjectCard with intersection observer
const ProjectCard = React.memo(({ project, index }) => {
  const [setRef] = useIntersectionObserver(0.1, '100px');
  return (
    <motion.div ref={setRef} ...>
```

### After (Fixed):
```javascript
// Removed problematic imports
import React, { useState, useCallback, useMemo } from 'react';
import { motion, AnimatePresence, useReducedMotion } from 'framer-motion';

// Simplified ProjectCard without intersection observer
const ProjectCard = React.memo(({ project, index }) => {
  return (
    <motion.div ...>
```

## Current Status
✅ Projects page loads successfully  
✅ All project cards render properly  
✅ Images display correctly (including the fixed Meijer e-commerce SVG)  
✅ Filter functionality works (All Projects / Featured)  
✅ Animations and hover effects preserved  
✅ No compilation errors or warnings  
✅ Responsive design maintained  

## Performance Notes
- Removed image preloading optimization temporarily for stability
- Removed intersection observer for lazy loading (can be re-added later if needed)
- Core functionality and user experience remain intact
- All project data from portfolioData.js displays correctly

The Projects section now loads and displays all your projects properly, including:
- E-commerce Platform (ECP & CP4L)
- webOS TV Applications Suite  
- IoT Dashboard - Shell Netherlands
- Autonomous Vehicle Perception Dashboard
- E-commerce Checkout & Product Pages (with fixed image)

You can navigate to the Projects section and see all your projects with their images, descriptions, and technology stacks.
