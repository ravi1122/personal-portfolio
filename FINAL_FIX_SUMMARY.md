# Issues Resolution Summary

## âœ… Both Issues Successfully Fixed!

### Issue 1: About Me Image Cropping
**Problem**: Profile image was being cut off at the top in the About Me section.
**Solution**: 
- Changed container height from square to taller aspect ratio (`h-96/h-[450px]`)
- Used `object-contain` instead of `object-cover` to show full image without cropping
- Added proper centering and padding for better visual presentation

### Issue 2: Projects Page Not Loading
**Problem**: Projects section stopped loading after debugging the image issue.
**Root Cause**: Accidentally removed the `useIntersectionObserver` import during debugging.
**Solution**: 
- Restored the proper imports: `useIntersectionObserver`, `useImagePreloader`
- Restored the image preloading logic for performance
- Restored the intersection observer ref in ProjectCard component

## Current Status
âœ… **About Me image displays fully** - No more top cropping  
âœ… **Projects page loads successfully** - All projects visible  
âœ… **All project images display correctly** - Including fixed Meijer e-commerce SVG  
âœ… **Performance optimizations maintained** - Intersection observer and image preloading working  
âœ… **Animations and interactions work** - Hover effects and smooth transitions  
âœ… **Filter functionality works** - All Projects / Featured filters  
âœ… **Responsive design intact** - Works on all screen sizes
